=head1 NAME

App::Exifpic - Extract embedded jpegs from RAW files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The guts of the L<exifpic> command line utility.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

    App::Exifpic->run(@ARGV);

Runs the application. Assumes all arguments are filenames to be processed.

=head2 process_image

    App::Exifpic->process_image($filename);

Extracts the embedded jpeg from the specified file, copying the metadata,
and writing the results to the same filename, but with a .jpg extension.

=head2 get_cores

    my $cores = App::Exifpic->get_cores;

Returns the number of cores on this machine.  Assumes the
F</proc/cpuinfo> file exists.

=head1 BUGS

All of them.  Patches seriously welcome.  Use the repo at
L<https://github.com/pfenwick/app-exifpic> and send me pull requests.
